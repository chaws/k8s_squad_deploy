how to SSH thru instances:
1. Generate a keypair
2. Use that keypair's public key to add to all instances
3. Keep keypair's private key in ansible vault
4. Then each developer (Me, Milosz, Amro, Antonio) can use GPG to decrypt ssh private key
4.1. With private key decrypted, one can just log in into instances :)
